As a new year begins one must make an effort to continue their personal development by following creative endeavors, while I've had blogs in the past I found that I had gotten out of the habit of creative technical writing and decided to take this opportunity to try out [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) with a new design and format for the blog.

Jekyll has been surprisingly versatile and easy to setup, not to mention vastly more secure than any dynamic blogging software that exists. Within a few hours I had a design and some test posts put together, and within a few days something resembling a website had emerged from a surprisingly small number of files.

The format I've chosen is to have more in-depth articles interleaved by links, quotes and words that have piqued my interest throughout the month allowing for a frequently updating blog without the necessity to write a long genuinely interesting article every week.

My favorite things about Jekyll are:

 * Everything is plain text files
 * GitHub flavored markdown
 * I can edit everything offline using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
 * Liquid templates are very similar to Django's
 * Rich user-defined YAML metadata for posts
 * Everything is compiled to static files
 * No limitations on structure or organization
 * Plugins like [`jekyll-press`](https://github.com/stereobooster/jekyll-press)

The source code for this site can be found on my GitHub account at [http://github.com/harryr/logicista](http://github.com/harryr/logicista). Many thanks to [Cal / foxx](https://github.com/foxx/foxx.github.io) for providing much needed inspiration and getting me started with Jekyll by providing source code for his blog, after hearing him evangelise it in comparison to WordPress I just had to try it out.

Colors were taken from [Flatdesigncolors.com](http://www.flatdesigncolors.com/) and the typeface used throughout is a free font called [Maven Pro](http://vissol.co.uk/mavenpro/), the rest of the design is my own work taking inspiration from multiple sources while trying to maintain a clean, light and minimalist feel.
